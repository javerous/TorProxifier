/*
 About:
	This is 'breaker_prot' - it's the breaker who works by removing execution privilege on the page which covers the entry-point code.
 
 How-it-work ?
	When the CPU try to execute the instruction at the entry-point, it raises an exception because the protection doesn't allow it.
	This exception is forwarded as a SIGBUS / SIGSEGV to our process. We catch this signal to reset the original protection to the
	entry-point page. Once the signal handling is done, the CPU restart to the entry-point, and this time execute things as usual.
 
 Why ?
	The breaker allows us to do very last checking / changing (after all constructors), but before the app start to execute
	its main / start / whatever (the so-called "entry-point").
 
 Note :
	This breaker do the exact same job than 'breaker_int', but with another mechanism. Choose the one you want to use, but don't use
	the two at the same time (that's to say : don't compile & link the two breakers in the final lib).
 
	The two breakers are included in the project just to show two possible technic, and to let the choice between them.
